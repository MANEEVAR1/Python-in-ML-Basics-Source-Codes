# You have 2 strings "I am learning Python" & "Python is easier to learn as compared to Java"
# you need to:
# 1. Join these strings.
# 2. Extract any 2 substrings out of the joined string without:
# a) Usage of Stop Value
# b) Usage of Start Value
# 3. Check what happens if you set the step value as 9
# 4. From the String "Python is easier to learn as compared to Java" find the -1 index value and note your answer.
# 5. Convert each string into upper case.
# 6. Replace "Python" with "Java" and vice versa in individualÂ strings.
